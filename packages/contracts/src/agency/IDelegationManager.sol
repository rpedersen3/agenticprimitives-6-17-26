/**
 * @title IDelegationManager
 * @notice Manages delegations between agent accounts with caveat enforcement.
 *
 * Aligned with ERC-7710 (Smart Contract Delegation) patterns and inspired by
 * MetaMask delegation-framework:
 * - A delegation grants a delegate the right to act on behalf of a delegator
 * - Caveats constrain what the delegate can do (time, value, methods, targets)
 * - Delegations can be chained: A delegates to B, B delegates to C
 * - Revocation is immediate and on-chain
 * - Execution goes through the delegator's smart account (executeFromExecutor)
 *
 * ERC-7710 defines: redeemDelegations(bytes[], bytes32[], bytes[])
 * We provide both the typed `redeemDelegation` and the ERC-7710 opaque interface.
